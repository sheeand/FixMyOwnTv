      What Symptoms Indicate That Cleaning Is Necessary?</a> </h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Have you ever walked into a store that sells televisions and seen how  bright and crisp those
		 brand new projection televisions look? Compare this with
		the quality of the pictures on your TV. </p>
        <p>Projection TVs that need cleaning
		  will look as though every scene is in a fog, or is hazy.</p>
        <p> The haziness may be
		  more noticeable 1.) In the evening when there is minimal ambient light  in
		   the room, or 2.) While viewing scenes in which most
		  of the picture is near black, but also having some very bright content. The
		  bright content will tend make the dark area lighter. </p>
        <p>This haziness is generally
		    due to a layer of dust, or a film that has dirtied the glass lenses mounted on the <a href="#works">CRTs</a>
		    (and/or <a href="#opticals">mirror</a>).</p>
      </blockquote>
	  <h3><a name="works"><br />
	    How Projection TVs Work</a>
      </h3>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Projection televisions (more accurately termed &quot;rear-projection&quot; televisions)
	   fundamentally operate in a very similar fashion to that of ordinary (or &quot;direct-view&quot;)
	   televisions.  Both use picture tubes, also called <strong>CRTs</strong> (cathode-ray tubes), to display
	   pictures, or video images.  </p>
	    <p>A CRT generates an image by first emitting an electron
	     beam from an electron gun inside the narrow neck of the tube.  The electron beam is
	     then deflected in such a way as to scan entire fields of images across the
		  phosphorescent front face of the tube, many times a second.  </p>
	    <p>When the electron beam strikes the phosphor, light is produced.  The intensity of
	       the electron beam is modulated so as to produce the various shades of light intensity.</p>
	    <p>Projection televisions have three CRTs in them.  These CRTs are considerably smaller
		 than those found in direct view televisions, and they are also much brighter! Each CRT
	       projects a specific primary color of light - red, green and blue.  The various
		    intensities of
	       light from these three primary colors combine on the screen and produce the gamut of
           color available in color television.</p>
      </blockquote>
	  <h3 align="left"><a name="guns"><br />
      Is It Possible To Clean The &quot;Guns&quot;?</a> </h3>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>People sometimes use the phrase &quot;cleaning the guns&quot; when
		referring to cleaning their projection television. This is a misnomer. There is such a thing as an &quot;electron gun&quot; in each of the <a href="#works">CRTs</a>. But the electron guns are sealed inside the
		 glass envelope of the tube. Hence,  they are not accessible, and neither
		  do they need to be cleaned. What does need to be cleaned, however, are optical components.</p>
      </blockquote>
	  <h3 align="left"><a name="opticals">
	  <br />What Are The Optical Components Of A Projection Television?</a> </h3>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>There is a large cavity behind the screen of a projection TV.  This open space is called
 the <b>light box</b>.  Inside the light box there are the three <a href="#works">CRT</a> assemblies, and a large <strong>mirror</strong>.  The CRTs project their
 images upward toward the mirror. The mirror is mounted on an angle along the inside
 rear wall of the television. It  reflects the images  toward the front screen, where they converge and mix together on the translucent
 front screen to produce the color picture.</p>
        <p>The front screen is actually composed of two flat lenses which are sandwiched together. The fresnel lens faces inward and the
 lenticular lens faces outward. On some models there is
 a third layer, which is an outer protective screen. This layer  protects the lenticular lens from scratches and
 fingerprints from the outside world.</p>
        <p>Mounted on each CRT is an optical lens assembly.  It is these outer lenses, the lenses
 from which light is projected, that need to be cleaned.  (Note: The lens assemblies do not
 need to be removed from the CRTs.</p></blockquote>
 <blockquote><img src="before.jpg" alt="Photo of dirty lenses" width="538" height="192" />
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>Sometimes, the mirror may also need to be cleaned.  See <a href="CRT2.htm#mirror"><b>Cleaning The Mirror.</b></a>
 </blockquote>
<h3 align="left"><a name="protective"><br />
      Cleaning The Screen</a> </h3>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>The lenses that make up front screen (see above) should not be cleaned.  They can be easily scratched.  And, since they are vertical surfaces, they do not collect dust as do the CRT lenses.
 However, the outside surface of the screen may be dusted with a duster occassionally.</p>
        <p>If the television has a protective outer screen, its outer surface can be cleaned with a solution of mild detergent and water, and a soft cloth.  To know
 if you have an outer protective screen, turn off the television and look into the screen.
 The protective screen has a shiny surface.  In other words, you should be able to see the reflection of the
 room, like looking into the screen of an ordinary TV.</p>
