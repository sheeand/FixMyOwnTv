<h1>How to Order TV Parts</h1>
<p>Assuming that you know what part you need, you now have to specify the part so you can place an order for it. Preferably you have the manufacturer’s part number for the item. At the very least you should know the manufacturer’s description of it. If it is a component on a circuit board, the location number or reference number may be essential. You should also have the complete model number of the television. It will be printed on a sticker along the side or on the back of the unit.</p>
<p>Use the resource links provided by this web site to shop for your specific part.  You can also shop for a service manual for your TV.  Even though you may be able to order the part you need without the service manual, you may still need to refer to the service manual to perform the repair. The article relevant to your particular repair will tell you if you will.</p>
