            <h4>Reasons Why You Shouldn't Fix Your Own TV</h4>
        <p>If your TV is still covered under a warrantee, take advantage of it and call a service technician. Most manufacturers warrant their TVs for one year after the original purchase. You can find out what the manufacturer’s warrantee period is from either your sales receipt, the owner’s manual, or the company’s web site. If you purchased an extended service plan, find the receipt, or call the store where you purchased it to see if it is still covered.</p>
        <p>If it was severely damaged physically (like if it was dropped down a flight of stairs), then it's not worth fixing.  If it was exposed to the elements of nature (immersed in water due to flooding, or left outside where rain, dew, or condensation has caused damage), then it's not worth fixing. Moisture causes corrosion that will permenantly damage printed circuit boards.</p>
        <p> If the television is much smaller than a 50-inch (125-cm) it's probably not worth fixing anyway because of the comparative cost of replacing it with a new TV. If it's more than 10 years old it's probably not worth fixing (unless you're an antique collector), due to the availability of parts. Replacement parts may not be available for a TV that old. And even if they were, there's the issue of longevity. It's like fixing an old car - as soon as you fix one thing, chances are that something else will soon go wrong.</p>

            <h4>What's It Going To Cost?</h4>
        <p>You will have to determine if you will need to replace any defective parts in the TV.  The articles in the Solution Center portion of this website can help you determine this. Click the blue buttons and find the symptom that most closely resembles the problem. If you need to replace something like a circuit board or some other part inside the television, then it’s a matter of whether the part is available, whether you can afford to purchase it, and whether you are willing to replace it yourself.</p>
        <p>If you've determined that something needs to be replaced, you may want to know how much it would cost. See <a id="lnkVendors" href="?Article=Parts" target="_self">Replacement Parts For TVs</a> to get specific pricing for what you need. And to make sure you get everything you need, see <a id="lnkHow" href="?Article=OrderParts" target="_self">Could I Really Fix My Own TV?</a> To give you an idea of the cost of parts, below is a list of approximate costs (in US dollars) of some typically replaced parts.

        <h4>How Long Should A TV Last?</h4>
        <p>Like anything man-made, TVs will eventually break down. You should expect to get about eight to ten years of useful life out of a TV. But if the TV is not that old, you may be surprised how "do-able" the fix really is (or you may learn that the culprit is not the TV at all!).</p>
