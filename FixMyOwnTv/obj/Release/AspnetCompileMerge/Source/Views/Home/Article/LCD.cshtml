        <p>The process of replacing any flat screen display is like replacing a part of an engine in your car – you have to remove some parts to get to what you need to replace, and then put it all back together again in the reverse order. Unlike working on a car, replacing an LCD or an LED panel will not get you dirty. But it will take some mechanical know-how, so if you’re not comfortable about disassembling and reassembling a whole lot of stuff, you may want to get a friend to help you. Practically speaking, it's best to have someone else with you while you’re doing the job. Your assistant can help you keep track of the parts you remove and how they go back.  They can also help you do any lifting.  If the size of the TV is 50-inches (130-cm) or greater, you will definitely need someone else helping you.</p>

        <p>The service manual would be a handy reference to have. It might have special instructions specific to your model that you may need to know concerning replacing the panel.</p>
        <h4>What to do when the shipment comes in</h4>
        <p>Once you receive the replacement panel, inspect it and make sure it has not been physically damaged during shipping.</p>

    <h4>Replacing the Display Panel</h4>
        <p>Remove the metal plate that supported the stand. Next, you will be removing one or two circuit boards. The main board (the board with all the jacks and ports on it) will definitely come off because the main board never comes with replacement panels. And unless there is a power board already on the replacement panel, you'll have to remove the power board from the original panel as well. There is useful information about unhooking cables from circuit boards in the article, <a id="lnkBoards" href="?Article=Boards" target="_blank">Replacing Circuit Boards</a>.</p>

        <p>Sometimes the original and the replacement panel assemblies won't look alike. The circuit boards on the replacement panel may not be identical to the boards on the original panel. Don’t be alarmed – you probably received a substitute, which is generally not a bad thing considering that the sub is usually an improved version of the original assembly. It should all still connect up to the main board and the power board. You could go ahead and mount them onto the replacement assembly at this time, to satisfy your curiosity.</p>
        <p>There should be some hardware around the perimeter of the panel holding it to the bezel (frame). Remove the screws and any hardware attaching the panel to the bezel. Now you (and your assistant, if needed) should be able to lift the panel away from the bezel and set it aside.</p>
        <p>Take the replacement panel, place it into the bezel, and put everything back together again in the reverse order. Take the circuit board(s) you removed from the original panel, mount them in the replacement panel and connect all the cables. If you are shipping the original panel back for core value, put the plastic structure(s) that came with the replacement panel back onto the original panel and pack it back in the box in which the replacement came.</p>
