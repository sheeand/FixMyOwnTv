        <h1>Speaker Rattle or Buzz</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>A rattle or buzz coming from the TV that coincides with the audio can be either an acoustic problem or a problem involving electronics. If it is a constant noise that seems to have no coorelation with the audio, the cause is most likely electronic.</p>
        <hgroup>
            <h3>Acoustic Problems</h3>
        </hgroup>
        <p>If the problem comes and goes depending on what is being heard (i.e. certain tones in the audio), it could be caused by
        <ol>
            <li>The vibration of an object near the TV</li>
            <li>The vibration of something inside the TV</li>
            <li>The speakers themselves, or</li>
            <li>A faulty main (signal) board</li>
        </ol></p>
<h4>External resonances</h4>
        <p>If the TV is situated inside of a cabinet or an entertainment center, listen to see if the noise is coming from something inside the cabinet such as a vase, curio, or picture frame.   Try removing anything of this nature from the vicinity of the TV and see if the noise goes away.  If it persists, then it's got to be either something inside the TV or the speakers themselves.</p>
<h4>Internal resonances</h4>
        <p>If you suspect that the noise is coming from the TV's own cabinet, remove the back cover and apply friction tape along the lip of the bezel (frame) where it meets the back cover, and anywhere else that might cause the back cover to rattle against the panel superstructure.  Secure any loose wires or cable bundles that are dressed against the inside of the cabinet with electrical tape. </p>
<h4>Blown speakers</h4>
        <p> You can tell if a speaker is blown if the sound coming from it is fuzzy at any volume level, or if it makes loud popping noises at high volumes.</p>
        <p>Speakers as replacement parts in flat screen TVs are quite common.  They are generally not that expensive.  They can be damaged by excessively loud, “boomy” music.</p>
        <p>To avoid blowing the speakers in your TV, keep the bass and treble controls near mid position, and don’t crank-up the volume beyond the level of a normal conversation.</p>

        <h4>Test signals</h4>
        <p>One way of testing your speakers is by using a test signal. Go to <a href="http://www.mytvtestdisc.com" target="_blank">www.myTvTestDisc.com</a>, and download either the test DVD or the Audio Vibration Sweep, one of many video test signals available on this web site.  This test signal produces an audio tone that sweeps across a low-frequency range.  The tone can be used to check for acoustic vibration.</p>
        <p>Play the vibration test signal, adjust the volume to a low setting, and then listen for a buzz in the speakers.  If the buzz only occurs at particular places along the sweep (resonant frequencies), the problem is most likely something other than the speakers, as previously discussed.  If the buzz is heard across a wide portion of the sweep, then the speakers are bad.  If the buzz is heard over the entire sweep, or if it sounds like there is a scratchy distortion or a rushing noise mixed with the tone, then the problem is electronic and the main board would need to be replaced.</p>
<h4>Why Is The Sound Quality From The TV So Poor?</h4>
        <p>Manufacturers make compromises when designing flat screen TVs in order to make them flat. One of the biggest tradeoffs involves the speakers. The early flat screen TVs contained thin, flat, oval speakers facing the front. Many of today’s flat screen TVs have speakers located at the bottom of the cabinet facing down.  The speakers are 1½-by-½ inches (3.5-by-3.5 cm), mounted in skinny 5-inch (13-cm) long plastic enclosures. In the more recent ultra-thin LED TVs you will find 1-by-½ inch (3-by-7 cm) speakers mounted in 6-inch (15-cm) square enclosures that are about as thick as a pancake. These speakers project the sound toward the back of the TV.  Needless to say the sound quality that comes from these kinds of speakers is no match to what a larger speaker system can provide.  This is why many people connect their TV to a sound bar, or configure their TV with an A-V receiver.</p>

            <h3>Electronic Problems</h3>
        </hgroup>
        <p>
            If the problem is electronic, this is how you can find out if the problem is in the TV:
            <ul>
                <li>Try listening to more than one source, i.e. a DVD, video game, or off-air TV.  If you hear the problem from only one device, then the cause is probably that device. As a workaround, try connecting whatever that device is to the TV another way (via HDMI, component video, or composite video are three possible ways) and see if the problem goes away.</li>
                <li>Try other audio output devices.  Most TVs have either optical or analog audio output jacks.  If it is possible to connect one of these outputs to another device such as an A-V receiver, see if you can still hear the problem that way.</li>
                <li>If the TV is connected to an A-V receiver, disconnect or mute it and turn-up or enable the volume on your TV speakers. If you don't hear the problem that way, then your A-V receiver or speakers are at fault.</li>
                <li>If the problem occurs with every input device or signal source, then all fingers point to the TV.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If you have determined that the problem is in the TV, then you will need to replace the main (or signal) circuit board.  Go to <a id="lnkBoards" href="?Article=Boards" target="_self">Replacing Circuit Boards</a> and <a id="lnkOrderParts" href="?Article=OrderParts" target="_self">How to Order TV Parts</a> for details about how to do this.</p>
        <p>If the problem is that there is an echo in the sound, perform a software update on the TV.</p>
