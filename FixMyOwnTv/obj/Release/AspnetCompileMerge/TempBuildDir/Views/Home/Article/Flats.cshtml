        <p>For routine dusting, a feather duster is all that you should need to dust the face of the screen and along the top of the TV. To remove fingerprints, try using a dry microfiber cloth.  Be careful not to apply too much pressure while cleaning to avoid scratching the surface. For heavily-soiled spots, cleaning products are available that are specifically made for that purpose. </p>
        <p><em>Use cleaning products that containg <u>no alcohol</u> and <u>no ammonia</u>.</em></p>
        <p>The products suggested below will work on any plasma, LCD or LED television. Use a microfiber cloth for best results. Another thing to consider is that dust will sometimes build up in the air vents along the top of the rear cabinet.  You could use a vacuum with a brush attachment to clean these vents.  This will allow for proper heat dissipation and ventilation.</p>
