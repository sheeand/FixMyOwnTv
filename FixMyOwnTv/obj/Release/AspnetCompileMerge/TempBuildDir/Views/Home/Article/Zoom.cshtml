            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The TV picture is too big, or looks zoomed in too much so that you can't read the text crawling along the bottom of a news channel
                </li>
                <li>
                    The TV picture is too small and is surrounded by wide black borders
                </li>
                <li>
                    The TV picture looks narrow, it doesn't completely fill the screen, or there is space on either side of the picture
                </li>
                <li>
                    The TV picture looks stretched horizontally, or width-wise, so that everything is too wide, or people look fat
                </li>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
        </hgroup>
        <p>If you are watching off-the-air TV using an antenna or watching cable-TV without a cable set-top box, first try changing the channel. If the picture looks bad only on one channel, then the problem is because of that particular channel. You may find a remedy for this in the section entitled <a href="#Automatic">Automatic TV Settings</a>.</p>
        <p>If the picture size is consistently wrong on more than one channel no matter how the TV is connected, it's probably because a button got pushed on the TV remote control by mistake. To resolve this, first grab the remote control that came with the television. If you have a universal remote, don't use it because it may not give you the buttons that you need for this procedure. Look for a button labelled "WIDE", "ASPECT", "P SIZE", or "ZOOM".  When you push this button one time, the TV should display the mode in which it is currently set. Remember this setting - you may need to return to it! Next, try changing the setting, either by making a menu selection or by pushing that same button more than once. See if you can find the setting that will cause the picture to fill the screen like it did before the mishap.</p>
        <p>If the TV remote does not have any buttons like that, then go to the TV’s menu and look for an option called "Picture", "Options", or "Screen". Select this option. Now look for another option called "Aspect", "Screen Size", or "Aspect Ratio". Select that option. You should now see the current setting displayed on the screen.  Remember this current setting before you make any changes. Next, change the setting until you find one that will fill the screen properly.</p>
		<p>If none of those procedures help you obtain a picture that fills the screen properly then the problem is not the TV, but rather the source that is feeding the TV (such as a cable box, satellite receiver, DVD player, etc.).  Before you continue, put the settings back the way they were before you made any changes. </p>
        <aside id='InLineAdDiv2' style='text-align:center; margin:5px 10px 0px 10px;'></aside>
        <p>Next, we will consider the culprit being the device connected to the TV, such as a DVD player, cable set-top box, satellite receiver, or streaming internet media adapter. If there is more than one device connected to the TV, we are assuming that only one of them is causing the picture size problem; make sure the TV is switched to that source. Grab the remote control that came with that device. Look for a button on the remote labeled "WIDE", "ASPECT", or "ZOOM".   When you push this button one time, the TV should display the mode in which the device is currently set. Remember this setting! Next, try changing the setting, either by a menu selection or by pushing that button a few times, and see if you can find the setting that will cause the picture to fill the screen like it did before the mishap.</p>
        <p>If the remote does not have such buttons, go to the menu and select the option with either the word "Options" or "Set Up". Then, look for another option called "Aspect", "Screen Size", or "Aspect Ratio”.  Make note of the current setting, and then change it and see if you can find one that will cause the picture to fill the screen like it did.</p>
        <p>If you haven't solved the problem yet, one more thing you can try is to look for an option containing the word "Format" or "Resolution".  It should be set to either "720p", "1080i", or "1080p" for a wide-screen display.</p>
        <h4 id="Automatic">Automatic TV Settings</h4>
        <p>If you can get the picture to look right for some programs, channels, or movies, but not for others, you may be dealing with the way it is being broadcast or the way it was recorded. Some TVs have ways of adapting to this by automatically changing the picture size according to the incoming format. To see if your TV does this you will need to explore the options available in your Picture menu. The owner's manual can also tell you if the TV is capable of this. If the TV does not have this feature, then the problem is beyond your control and you will just have to deal with it.</p>
        <h4>Limitations of Using HDMI Cables</h4>
        <p>You may run up against limitations involving resizing the picture with many makes and models when HDMI cables are being used. If the problem with which you are dealing has always been that the high-definition channels look fine while the narrower <a href="#standard">standard-definition</a> channels don't fill the screen horizontally, it may be because you are using an HDMI cable.</p>
        <p>An HDMI cable connecting your TV to a DVD player, cable set-top box, satellite receiver, or streaming internet media adapter may limit your picture resizing options, and you may be stuck with a picture that is always displayed the way both the broadcaster and TV manufacturer want it to be viewed. The reason why the size of the TV picture cannot be changed is because the picture format (defined by the program or broadcaster) is part of the signal that travels through the HDMI cable, and the television must abide by the signal.</p>
        <p>One way to enable the TV's picture size feature is by using a different means of connecting the device to the TV, such as using the component video input or composite video input on your TV. The downside of this, however, is that you may loose some picture quality. See <a id="lnkGetTo" href="?Article=HookedUp" target="_self">How Is My TV Hooked Up?</a>.</p>

            <h3>Analysis - a brief history of high-definition</h3>
        </hgroup>
        <p>Why are TVs so complicated these days?  Why is the TV capable of displaying a picture incorrectly? To answer this, let's to go back a few years to the time when high-definition television was first introduced. High-definition brought the viewer a whole new "wide screen" picture. New digital transmission systems for off-air TV and for cable TV were being developed to deliver this new high-definition picture. There was a lot going on and there were many factors the inventors of high-definition had to consider in the design of the system. Among the considerations was that they did not want the new wide-screen way of framing video to replace the original shape. So they included it among the many new formats making it an option along with the others.</p>
        <p>The intent was to give broadcasters, DVD manufacturers and streaming video providers the freedom to choose how they wanted their picture to be framed. Consequently, the dimensions of the picture may not always be consistent from one source to another, or between TV channels, programs, or even commercials. The fact of the matter is that some channels, programs or movies are not really meant to entirely fill these new wide TV screens.</p>
        <p>This brings us to the other piece of the puzzle, namely the shape of the television screen itself. Today, you cannot purchase a TV that does not have a wide screen. The width-to-height ratio of a wide screen is 16-by-9. This is called the "aspect ratio". The old-school analog TV screens, along with TV programs that were produced back in the late 1900's, had an aspect ratio of 4-by-3. As mentioned above, today's modern digital TV system accomodates both of these formats. In fact, the original specification allowed for up to 18 variations of picture formats (although many of them are not used).</p>
        <p id="standard">The digital system format having the original, narrower 4-by-3 aspect ratio is known as "standard definition".  It should be no surprise that when this format is properly displayed on a wide 16:9 screen, the picture should not fill the screen horizontally.  There should be a gap on both sides of the picture - this is known as "pillarboxing". Depending on your picture settings, you may find that on some high-definition channels, some of the programs or commercials will fill the whole screen, while others will not. Pictures that do not fill the screen are like that because of their format. In fact, this is the way they were meant to be displayed.</p>
        <p>The flip side of this happens when a program or signal source having a wide-screen format is viewed on a 4-by-3 display. The picture will appear in the middle of the screen sandwiched between a layer of black on the top and on the bottom. It will be as if the picture was being viewed through a letterbox on the front door of a house. This technique of format accommodation is known as "letterboxing", and it is the only way that the whole wide screen picture can be viewed without distortion.</p>
        <p>In spite of how the inventors, the broadcasters, and the film-makers intended for viewers to watch their stuff, some people prefer to have their wide TV screen completely filled all of the time, regardless of the incoming picture format. To satisfy this need, many TVs (and some set-top boxes) have a setting that will "stretch" the pictures when they are narrow so that they fill the screen all of the time. You would probably find this feature in the Picture menu on the TV, or in the Set Up menu on the set-top box. Check the owner's manual for your television to see if that feature is available, or call your cable or satellite TV service provider. This setting will cause all 4-by-3 material to be horizontally stretched, or what is known as "anamorphic". Some viewers may find this to be visually disturbing, while others will not be bothered by the distortion at all. </p>
        <p>Bonus tip:  If you have an old Comcast cable box (pre-Xfinity), you can change the digital format of the HDMI signal going to the TV (e.g. 720p, 1080i, etc.) by accessing a special service mode.  With the TV on, turn off the set-top box and then press the Menu button on the Comcast remote.  A service menu will appear on the TV by which you can make changes using the arrow controls on the remote.  When finished, power-down and power-up the set-top box.</p>
