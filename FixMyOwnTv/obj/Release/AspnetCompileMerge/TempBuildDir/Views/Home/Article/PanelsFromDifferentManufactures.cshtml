<p>It is possible that you may receive a panel made by a another company. This can happen if the TV was designed for panels made by more than one manufacturer.  There are also a few cases where a manufacturer may substitute a panel made by a different manufacturer. In any case, if you order the part from a supplier specifying the OEM part number, and rely on the part supplier to deliver the proper screen, you should be in good shape. Part suppliers get it right 99% of the time.  So, for example, if you receive a Samsung replacement panel for an Insignia television, chances are that you have the correct part.</p>
