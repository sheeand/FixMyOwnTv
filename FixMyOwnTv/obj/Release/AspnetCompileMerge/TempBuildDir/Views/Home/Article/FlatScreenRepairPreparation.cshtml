<h4>Preparation</h4>
    <p>To work on any flat screen TV requires some preparation. If the TV is mounted on the wall, it will have to be taken down. You will need to prepare a place to work where there is plenty of room to lay the TV down horizontally on its face. Contrary to popular myth, it is okay to lay a flat screen TV down horizontally. Read the article <a id="lnkReality" href="?Article=Myth-Reality" target="_self">Plasma TVs - Myths vs. Realities?</a> for more details. If the TV is less than a 50-inch (130-cm), a large table would be suitable. Make sure the surface is flat, soft (e.g. covered with a blanket) and wide enough so that the screen does not hang off the edge. If the TV sits on a stand, position the TV such that the stand hangs over the end of the surface, and remove the stand.</p>
    <p>If the TV is a 56-inch (140-cm) set or larger, then laying the TV down on a freshly-vacuumed, carpeted floor might be your best option. If the TV is on a stand, you will need to remove the stand from the TV before you lay it down. With most TVs, this can be done as follows: 1) While it is in its normal upright position, unscrew and remove the screws holding the stand, then 2) gently lift the TV up and off of its stand, and lay it face down on the floor.</p>

<h4>Removing the Back Cover</h4>
    <p>Now you are ready to remove the screws that hold the back cover in place. There may be up to four variations of sizes and threads, so pay close attention to the screws as you remove them. You will want to remember where they go when you are ready to put the back cover back on. If the TV has a VGA connector for hooking up to a computer, you may need to remove the two screw posts that are on either side of the connector. There may also be a nut on a coaxial cable (TV/Cable) connector that would need to be removed. On some of the new LED TVs you will have to remove the little door where the power cord comes out in order to get the back cover off. Be very careful when lifting the back cover because some have very sharp edges, on which you could easily cut yourself.</p>
    <p>Some 38-inch (96-cm) TVs may have plastic back covers that will not seem to want to come off, even after you’ve removed all of the screws. These back covers are latched into the bezel (frame) with tabs. You will need to forcefully pull apart the back cover from the plastic latches along the bezel rim (like prying a hub cap off of the wheel of a car). Non-slip gloves are a great thing to wear for this. Just start somewhere along the bottom edge and continue around until the whole cover pops off.</p>
    <p>WARNING: Always leave the power cord disconnected from the television when the back cover is removed, unless otherwise instructed.</p>
