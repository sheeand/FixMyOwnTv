            <h4>Can the TV be fixed? </h4>
        </hgroup>
        <p>In most cases, depending on the availability of replacement parts, your TV can be fixed.</p>
        <p>A cracked or broken TV screen cannot be repaired - it can only be replaced, regardless of whether it is an LCD, LED or plasma panel. Fortunately, replacement panels can be ordered from many TV parts suppliers, depending on the make and model. If you want to know where to buy a replacement LED, LCD or plasma display panel, see <a id="lnkPlasma" href="?Article=Plasma" target="_self">TV Replacement Parts</a>. If you decide that you want to try replacing the panel yourself, read <a id="lnkPlasma" href="?Article=Plasma" target="_self">How To Replace Plasma Display Panels</a>, or <a id="lnkLCD" href="?Article=LCD" target="_self">How To Replace LCD and LED Panels</a>.</p>
        <p>If you would rather have someone else do it for you, schedule a service call and have a TV service technician come to your home and give you a free cost estimate.</p>

            <h4>Would it be worth fixing economically? </h4>
        </hgroup>
        <p>You would have to consider the cost of a new TV verses the cost of a replacement panel together with the work it would take to replace it, as well as many other considerations. Read <a id="lnkPlasma" href="?Article=Worth-Fixing" target="_self">Is My TV Worth Fixing?</a></p>

            <h4>How to know if the panel is cracked</h4>
        </hgroup>
        <p>Knowing whether or not the screen is cracked is sometimes obvious, and sometimes not. The best way to diagnose the problem is to watch and listen to see and hear what happens when you try to turn on the television.  The symptoms will vary depending on the kind of panel it is and the amount of damage that was done. If you have an LCD or an LED panel, it will usually display a kaleidoscope of disturbing, multicolored, orthogonal lines and shapes at the place where the damage occurred. The picture shown on the rest of the screen could either be okay, or dim, or completely black.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, plasma display panels have a more varied look and behavior.  Some panels will seem to work just fine with cracks in them. Others won't hardly light up at all.  Some TVs will produce a loud buzzing noise.  And some just won't turn on at all.</p>
        <hgroup>
            <h4>Could a TV screen crack all by itself?</h4>
        </hgroup>
        <p>It is possible for screens to crack without having had any external blunt force applied to them. Later in this article, we will explore some of these cases where physical impact is not the issue.</p>
        <p>A common misconception is that if a screen has no cracks or scratches on its outer surface, then the damage must have been caused by an internal defect. This is not necessarily true. The fact is that the protective outer surface of the screen is made of a durable, scratch-resistant material. It will withstand a blow without a scratch. Yet the layers beneath the surface of the screen are very fragile and can easily be damage by physical impact.

        <h2>Causes of Cracked Screens - Warrantee Coverage</h2>
    </header>
    <section>
        <hgroup>
            <h4>Stress Fractures </h4>
        </hgroup>
        <p>Stress fractures are generally one single crack starting from an edge and extending across the screen. They can be caused by vibration during shipment, mechanical stress during unpacking, or any kind of physical force that would flex one corner of the unit.</p>
        <p>As a general rule, no warranty will cover cracked plasma panels. Most technicians would tell you that there’s nothing they can do, aside from giving you an estimate for the cost of the repair. But for stress fractures (as described above), if the TV is still under manufacturer's warrantee, and the crack has not grown into a widespread shatter, there is a chance that the TV could be exchanged by the manufacturer, especially if you can prove that the damage occurred while the TV was being shipped to your home. This is why it is very important that you test the TV by turning it on as soon as you get it home, to be sure that it is in good working order. It is more believable when you report shipping damage to the store within 24 hours of the purchase. If the TV is being delivered to your home, be sure that you test the TV before the delivery people leave the scene.</p>
        <p>Sometimes stress fractures will occur days after the television has been in delivered to the home. These cases are generally not under warranty by the store from which it was purchased, but instead by the TV manufacturer's customer service department. When dealing with the manufacturer, be prepared to thoroughly plead your case because it is more difficult to prove that the cause was not your fault. It would be a good idea to call a service technician because they can do the leg work of contacting the manufacturer for you. Otherwise, you’ll have to correspond with the manufacturer yourself by sending them an email with your name, address, date of purchase, place of purchase, model number, serial number with attached pictures and sales receipt. You should take pictures of the crack(s), the front cabinet showing the crack and the manufacturer’s insignia, and the back of unit showing the product sticker. Whether you do it yourself or have a technician take care of it for you, be careful not to physically move the TV. Any movement might cause the fracture to grow worse before the photos are taken. The cracks may end up looking more like they were caused by deliberate physical damage, at which point the financial burden of replacing the panel may be on you.</p>

            <h4>Spider Cracks</h4>
        </hgroup>
        <p>There have been rare cases where these strange cracks would mysteriously appear. The crack would have from three to several veins extending an inch or two (2.5 to 5 cm) from one single point, resembling a starburst, a cross, or spokes of a wheel. This kind of crack allegedly occurs without any external cause. The forums and blogs call them "spider cracks".  As of yet there is no official information from any manufacturer about this phenomenon. Even though consumers claim that spider cracks happen on their own, it's a hard argument to prove to the manufacturer. The conspicuous central point of the crack argues that a physical impact may have been the cause. Therefore, manufacturers will generally deduce that the damage was caused by physical abuse, and so the repair will not be covered under factory warranty. Even so, it is still worth a service call because some companies will replace the panel or exchange the unit if it is still under manufacturer's warrantee or an extended warranty contract, if a technician dutifully reports that the damage was not caused by abuse.</p>

        <p>Many bloggers and publishers have written about this issue saying that the reason why this phenomenon would occur is because of excessive heat being generated by the panel. I think that this is only part of the reason. All plasma panels generate heat. So, if this phenomenon is indeed a problem with the panel, then it has to be because of a manufacturing defect. My hypothesis is that there could have been a single pixel (or a small cluster of them) that sustained some kind of abnormality or may have gotten contaminated during the manufacturing process. (If you want to learn more about the construction of a plasma display panel, read <a id="lnkMyth" href="?Article=Myth-Reality" target="_self">Plasma TVs - Myths vs. Realities?</a>). Under normal use a TV is turned on, stays on for a while, and then is turned off. When the TV is on the panel warms up, and when the TV is off the panel cools down. This is normal. But if the panel had a defect, over the course of time this heating up and cooling down would weaken the panel at the point of the defect, and eventually caused the glass in the panel to fracture by virtue of thermal expansion and contraction.</p>

        <p>It is certainly disappointing when the focal point of your home entertainment system has been put out of service.  But it can be fixed. And what’s more, it would cost you less to fix it yourself than it would to replace the whole TV.</p>
