        <p>In this senario the picture and sound could have been just fine, but then all of a sudden the picture and sound disappear, and then come back again.  Depending on the make and model, a message may appear on the screen saying something like "No connection", "Check Your Cable", "Invalid Signal Format" or "Weak Signal". </p>

        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <p>First you need to rule out any possibility that the problem is not the TV.  If you have a DVD or Blue-ray player connected to your TV, watch a movie and see if the same thing happens.  If movies play okay, then the problem is probably not the TV.  But if it does happen watching movies, and if you are using an HDMI input for the player, skip to the next paragraph.  If you are NOT using an HDMI input for the player, then You'll need to arrange to have a TV service technician come and look at your TV.</p>
        <p>To dig further, you will need to know how your TV is hooked up.  You may read, <a id="lnkHooked" href="?Article=HookedUp" target="_self">How Is My TV Hooked Up?</a> for assistance.  What is the name of the input or source displayed on the screen when you watch TV?  If it’s the "TV" or "ANT" input, then it will either be 1.) a weak signal coming from your antenna, cable box, or satellite receiver, or 2.) a loose or faulty cable connection somewhere between the TV and the where it goes.  Try changing channels.  The problem may occur on all channels, some channels, or just a few channels.  If you use a set-top box, or if you use an antenna and live in the city where you should expect to have good TV reception, the cause is usually a bad cable connector.  If you found that the problem began when the weather was rainy or windy, that’s good clue that the faulty connector is somewhere outside. </p>
        <p>If you watch TV using an HDMI input or source, and the DVD or Blue-ray movie played fine, then the causes could be either 1.) a bad cable connection upstream from your set-top box, or 2.) that there is an HDMI incompatibility issue at play between the TV and the set-top box.  If it’s a bad cable connection, follow the advice from the previous paragraph.  If it’s an HDMI incompatibility issue, this means that your cable or satellite TV service provider has done something to change the software in your set-top box.  There may be a software update that can be performed on the TV that will cure the problem.  You can read, <a id="lnkUpdate" href="?Article=Update" target="_self">Updates</a> on how to do that.  If the latest software is installed in your TV and you still have the same problem, then you need to contact your cable or satellite TV service provider, because the problem is not with your television. </p>
