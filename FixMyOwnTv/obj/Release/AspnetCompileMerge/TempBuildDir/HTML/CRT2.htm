	  <blockquote>
	    <p> On most models, the CRT lenses and mirror can be accessed from the rear of the unit by removing the
  back cover of the television (this is the panel with all the air holes). Please be sure to read the important paragraph
 regarding <a href="#safety"><b>Safety</b></a> below, before attempting this.</p>
        <p>On some models the CRT lenses and mirror cannot be accessed
 from the rear.  For these models the front screen will need to be removed.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>If it is necessary to remove the front screen, and if the television has a feature for
 automatic convergence or magic focus, there will be wires along the inside of the screen
 frame that connect to the television chassis. In order to remove the front screen assembly, these wires will need to be loosened from inside the unit. This can only be done from the rear of the unit by removing  the rear cover  to gain access. The wires will need to be located and disconnected from the chassis  to allow enough slack
 for the screen frame to be removed.    Loosen the wire ties that hold the wires against the cabinet and 
 follow the wires to the connector to which they plug into the
 printed circuit board. The connector may need to be unlatched from its board-mounted socket.</p>
          <p>The area where the wires connect to the chassis may be in close proximity to where high voltage exists.  Please read the important
 paragraph on <a href="#safety"><b>Safety</b></a> below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Removing the front screen is generally done by first removing the speaker grill.  On some
 models you may find screws, either behind the ends of the grill panel or along the bottom
 of the grill panel, that need to be removed.  Otherwise, the speaker grill should pull
 straight out and off of the unit (with a little gentle persuasion). Many speaker grills snap out like a hub cap on a car. </p>
<p>Removing the speaker grill exposes screws along the bottom edge of the screen frame.
 Remove these screws, along with any other screws that secure the screen
 frame to the body of the television.</p>
<blockquote>Some screen frames are held to the cabinet with snap-on retainers.  In
 this case, a bit of prying force may be necessary to break the frame loose.
 Start from the bottom and work your way up. (When replacing
 this type of screen frame back onto the cabinet, force it back into the snap-on retainers
 using blunt impacts along the frame with the palm of the hand.)</blockquote>

        Safety</a>
Hazard      </h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Televisions chassis generate high voltages in order to make the <a href="CRT.htm#works"><strong>CRTs</strong></a> produce light.
 There are areas on the chassis where this high voltage may exist. These areas are a potential shock hazard.</p>
        <p>The actual area
   where cleaning is done (inside the <a href="CRT.htm#opticals"><b>light box</b></a>) is safe from this hazard.  There are no harmful
   voltages in the light box.  However, the area below the shelf of the light box 
   houses the main chassis, where there are electrical components which contain high voltages.
   This area must be avoided. <u>Do not attempt to clean the electronics below the light box</u>.
   Dust is an electrical insulator - so, dust on printed circuit boards will
   not harm the television.  Please read the <a href="CRT.htm#disclaimer"><b>Disclaimer</b></a> posted on this web page.</p>

        Cleaning The CRT Lenses</a>
      </h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Here it is - the step you've been waiting for! </p>
        <p>Apply a non-streaking glass cleaner to a soft cloth and use it to wipe each lens clean.</p>
        <p>Remember, the lens assemblies do not need to be removed from the CRTs.</p>
    </blockquote>
      <h3><a name="often"><br />
        How Often Should The CRT Lenses Be Cleaned?</a>
      </h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Once every two to three years is generally sufficient.  Although, the lenses
 and mirror may need more frequent cleaning if the television is in a place where people
 smoke, or burn  incense.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3><a name="mirror"><br />
        Cleaning The Mirror</a>
      </h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The mirror suspended inside the rear of the television may also contribute to a hazy
 picture.  If the surface of the mirror is made of a flexible mylar film, this type of mirror
 generally cannot be cleaned - it can only be replaced.  If the surface of the mirror is made of glass, it can be cleaned
 the same way the CRT lenses are cleaned, with a non-streaking glass cleaner and a soft
 cloth.  The mirror will generally need to be cleaned only about half as often as do the CRT lenses,
 about once every 5 years.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3><a name="on"><br />
        Can The TV Be Turned On While Cleaning?</a>
      </h3>
      <blockquote><p>It is helpful to have the television turned on while cleaning the lenses.  It makes it easier
   to see how clean the lenses are with light shining through them.
 Please read the important paragraph on <a href="#safety"><b>Safety</b></a></p>
