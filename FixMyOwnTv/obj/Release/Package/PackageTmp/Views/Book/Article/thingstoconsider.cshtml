<h4>Preparation</h4>
<p>Replacing a display <a  href="http://www.fixmyowntv.com/faqs#panel" target="_blank">panel</a> is like replacing a part under the hood of your car. You may have to remove some parts to get to what needs to be replaced, and then put it all back together again in the reverse order. Unlike working on a car, replacing a display panel will not get you dirty.</p>
<p>It would be good to have someone else with you while you’re doing the job.  Your assistant can help you keep track of the parts and how they go back. It would also be good if one of you had some mechanical know-how. If the diagonal size of the TV screen is 50-inches (130-cm) or greater, you should have someone helping you with lifting it.</p>
<h4>Ordering the Display Panel</h4>
<p>To place an order for the panel from a TV parts distributor is not difficult. Follow the steps that are described in <a id="lnkOrder"  href="http://www.fixmyowntv.com/orderparts" target="_self">How to Order TV Parts</a>. The service manual would also be a handy reference to have if you have a high-end television. It might contain special instructions specific to your model. You can order one from a the suppliers listed under <em>Resources</em>.</p>

<h4>When the Shipment Comes In</h4>
<p>If the outer carton looks like it was punctured or bashed, don’t accept the shipment until you’ve inspected the contents thoroughly. Open the box and inspect the contents to make sure nothing has been physically damaged during shipping. Make sure there are no cracks in the screen.</p>
<p>Notice that there are circuit boards attached to the panel. This entire assembly will replace what is in your TV now. You will only need to transfer a few things from the original panel to the new one.</p>
