                        <p><strong>Panel</strong> (or <em>display panel</em>) is the term used by the TV manufacturing industry for the flat-panel display component of a television. <strong>Display</strong> is a generic term referring to the part of the TV that displays the image. The <strong>screen</strong> is the face of the panel (or for projection TVs it is the surface from which the video image appears).</p>

                        <p>Common types of display devices are <strong>LCD</strong> (liquid crystal display), <strong>LED</strong> (light-emitting diode), <strong>plasma</strong>, <strong>DLP</strong> (digital light processor), <strong>CRT</strong> (cathode-ray tube) or picture tube, and <strong>projection</strong> (which can be LCD, DLP or CRT).</p>

                        <p>Wouldn't it be cheaper to replace the bad part on the circuit board rather than replacing the whole board?</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>It may have been more economical to do that years ago. However, many of today's circuit boards use plated-through holes, fine-line copper traces, and surface-mount devices. These technologies have the positive effect of reducing manufacturing costs and increasing reliability. But they also make replacing most faulty components much too difficult, even for the experienced technician who uses the proper tools and techniques. That's why the TV repair industry is rapidly embracing board-level repair rather than replacing parts at the component-level.</p>

                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>Generally speaking, the answer is no. However, there are a few companies that design certain of their models using screens made by a different manufacturer. There are also a few cases where a vendor may substitute a panel made by a different manufacturer. In any event, if you order the part using the OEM part number, rely on the part supplier to deliver the proper screen. Part suppliers get it right 99% of the time. So if you receive a Samsung replacement panel for an Insignia television, chances are it is the correct part.</p>

                        <p>Is it okay to lay down a plasma TV horizontally?</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>Yes. It's okay to lay a plasma TV down horizontally, as long as you're careful. TV technicians many times will lay the TV face down on a padded table or workbench in order to service it. The surface just needs to be flat, soft (e.g. covered with a blanket) and wide enough so that the TV does not hang too far over the edge. The point is to avoid flexing the cabinet in such a way as to torque the panel. Twisting or flexing the panel could cause it to break. If it cracks, the panel will be completely ruined. This is why many people recommend keeping it vertical because it avoids the potential of applying undue stress to the panel. It is also recommended that the panel is secured upright in the vertical position when transporting it. This will keep the panel from flexing and breaking during shipment.</p>
