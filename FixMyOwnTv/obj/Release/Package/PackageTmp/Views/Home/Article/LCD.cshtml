        <h4>Replacing the Panel</h4>
        <p>Remove the metal plate that supported the stand. Next, you will be removing one or two circuit boards. The main board (the board with all the jacks and ports on it) will definitely come off because the main board never comes with replacement panels. And unless there is a power board already on the replacement panel, you'll have to remove the power board from the original panel as well. There is useful information about unhooking cables from circuit boards in the article, <a id="lnkBoards" href="/Boards" target="_blank">Replacing Circuit Boards</a>.</p>
        <aside id='InLineAdDiv3' style='text-align:center; '></aside>
        <p>Sometimes the original and the replacement panel assemblies won't look alike. The circuit boards on the replacement panel may not be identical to the boards on the original panel. Don’t be alarmed – you probably received a substitute, which is generally not a bad thing considering that the sub is usually an improved version of the original assembly. It should all still connect up to the main board and the power board. You could go ahead and mount them onto the replacement assembly at this time, to satisfy your curiosity.</p>
        <p>There should be some hardware around the perimeter of the panel holding it to the bezel (frame). Remove the screws and any hardware attaching the panel to the bezel. Now you (and your assistant, if needed) should be able to lift the panel away from the bezel and set it aside.</p>
        <p>Take the replacement panel, place it into the bezel, and put everything back together again in the reverse order. Take the circuit board(s) you removed from the original panel, mount them in the replacement panel and connect all the cables. If you are shipping the original panel back for core value, put the plastic structure(s) that came with the replacement panel back onto the original panel and pack it back in the box in which the replacement came.</p>
