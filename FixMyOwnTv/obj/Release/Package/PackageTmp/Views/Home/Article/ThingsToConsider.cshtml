<p>Replacing a <a href="/faqs" target="_blank">display panel</a> is like replacing a part under the hood of your car. You may have to remove some parts to get to what needs to be replaced, and then put it all back together again in the reverse order. Unlike working on a car, however, replacing a TV panel will not get you dirty, but it will take some mechanical know-how.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to have someone else with you while you’re doing the job. Your assistant can help you keep track of the parts and how they go back, and can help you with any lifting.  If the diagonal size of the TV screen is 50-inches (130-cm) or greater, you should have someone helping you.</p>
<p>To place an order for the panel from a TV parts distributor is not difficult. Follow the steps that are described in <a id="lnkOrder" href="/OrderParts" target="_self">How to Order TV Parts</a>. The service manual would also be a handy reference to have if you have a high-end television. It might contain special instructions specific to your model. You can order one from a the suppliers listed under <em>Resources</em>.</p>

<h4>What to do when the shipment comes in</h4>
<p>Once you’ve received the replacement panel, inspect it and make sure it has not been physically damaged during shipping. If the outer carton looks like it was punctured or bashed, don’t accept the shipment until you’ve inspected the contents thoroughly. Open the box and check to see if there are any cracks in the screen.</p>
