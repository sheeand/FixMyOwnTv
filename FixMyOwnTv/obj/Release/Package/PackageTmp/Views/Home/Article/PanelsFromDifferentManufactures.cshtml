<p>It is possible that you may receive a panel made by a another company. This can happen if the TV was designed for panels made by more than one manufacturer.  There are also a few cases where a manufacturer may substitute a panel made by a different manufacturer. In any case, if you order the part from a supplier specifying the OEM part number, and rely on the part supplier to deliver the proper screen, you should be in good shape. Part suppliers get it right 99% of the time.  So, for example, if you receive a Samsung replacement panel for an Insignia television, chances are that you have the correct part.</p>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<p>If the TV is mounted on the wall, it will have to be taken down. You will need to prepare a place to work where there is plenty of room to lay the TV down horizontally on its face. Contrary to popular myth, it is okay to lay a flat screen TV down horizontally. Read the article <a id="lnkReality" href="/Myth-Reality" target="_self">Plasma TVs - Myths vs. Realities?</a> for more details. If the TV is less than a 50-inch (130-cm), a large table would be suitable. Make sure the surface is flat, soft (e.g. covered with a blanket) and wide enough so that the screen does not hang over the edge. If the TV sits on a stand, position the TV such that the stand hangs over the end of the surface, and remove the stand.</p>
<p>If the diagonal size of the TV is 56-inches (140-cm) or larger, your best option might be to lay the TV up-side-down flat (with the rear of the TV facing up) on a freshly-vacuumed, carpeted floor. If the TV is on a stand, you will need to remove the stand from the TV before you lay it down. With most TVs, this can be done as follows: 1) While it is in its normal upright position, unscrew and remove the screws holding the stand, then 2) gently lift the TV up and off of its stand, and lay it face down on the floor.</p>
