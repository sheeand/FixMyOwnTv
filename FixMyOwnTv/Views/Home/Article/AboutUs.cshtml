        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>I have been employed in the field of television for most of my career. As a TV repair technician for over a decade, I completed almost 10,000 repairs. As an electrical engineer I worked for Thomson Consumer Electronics (RCA/Proscan) and for Philips Consumer Electronics (Magnavox/Sylvania/Philco). As a first-class FCC radiotelephone license holder I was a broadcast engineer for three television stations and a major market AM-FM radio station. Today, I am a web site developer for a major company in Indiana.  And the web site you are now visiting is a hobby of mine.</p>
        <h4>HD - First Contact</h4>
        <p>I recall working at Philips in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  In those days, high definition television was in its infancy, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Alliance_(HDTV)" target="_blank">Grand Alliance (HDTV) Consortium</a> was being formed. Even though it was an multi-national effort, contributions from the major domestic consumer electronic companies (which actually did exist at the time) were significant. I was among the enthusiastic engineers who were busily developing and wiring breadboard prototype circuits in laboratories. Others were writing code to be embedded into microprocessors that would be the TV's control systems, designing integrated circuits on CAD (computer-aided design) workstations.</p>
        <p>I had the awesome privilege of witnessing a functioning prototype of a high-definition television in the advanced development lab. The circuit boards that made up the chassis were strewn all over the workbench. The CRT (cathode-ray tube, or "picture tube") was a specially built 27-inch prototype that was designed to scan the raster with a very narrow beam and at twice the rate of conventional TVs of the day. I remember how beautiful that picture was on that screen. It looked just as crisp back then (in the 1990's) as it does on today's TVs. It was a sight to see!</p>
        <h4>Why this web site?</h4>
        <p>I built this web site to help people, to share what I know about how easy certain repairs can be. I do not recommend or condone any particular brand of television. My intent is to share insight and rudimentary instruction to help you make an informed decision, and to provide you with the resources necessary to facilitate the repair of your television.</p>
        <p>I would also like to invite you to visit my sister web site: <a href="http://www.mytvtestdisc.com" target="_blank">www.myTvTestDisc.com</a>. It offers free downloads of useful video test patterns.</p>
