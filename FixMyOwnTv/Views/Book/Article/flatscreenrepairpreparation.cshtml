    <p>Now you are ready to remove the screws that hold the back cover in place. There may be up to four variations of sizes and threads, so pay close attention to the screws as you remove them. You will want to remember where they go when you are ready to put the back cover back on. If the TV has a VGA connector for hooking up to a computer, you may need to remove the two screw posts that are on either side of the connector. There may also be a nut on a coaxial cable (TV/Cable) connector that would need to be removed. On some of the new LED TVs you will have to remove the little door where the power cord comes out in order to get the back cover off. Be very careful when lifting the back cover because some have very sharp edges, on which you could easily cut yourself.</p>
    <p>Some 38-inch (96-cm) TVs may have plastic back covers that will not seem to want to come off, even after you’ve removed all of the screws. These back covers are latched into the bezel (frame) with tabs. You will need to forcefully pull apart the back cover from the plastic latches along the bezel rim (like prying a hub cap off of the wheel of a car). Non-slip gloves are a great thing to wear for this. Just start somewhere along the bottom edge and continue around until the whole cover pops off.</p>
    <p>WARNING: Always leave the power cord disconnected from the television when the back cover is removed, unless otherwise instructed.</p>
